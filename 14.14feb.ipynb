    "# 2. Responsiveness: In a single-threaded environment, if a long-running task blocks the main thread, the entire application \n",
    "#                    becomes unresponsive. Multithreading can prevent this issue by running such tasks in separate threads,\n",
    "#                    ensuring the application remains responsive.\n",
    "# 3. Better resource utilization: Multithreading allows better utilization of system resources by keeping the CPU busy while\n",
    "#                                 waiting for I/O operations or other tasks to complete.\n",

    "\n",
    "# Disadvantages of Multithreading in Python:\n",
    "# 1. Complexity: Multithreading adds complexity to the program, making it more difficult to design, implement, and debug.\n",
    "# 2. Synchronization overhead: To avoid data corruption and maintain consistency, developers must synchronize access to shared \n",

    "# 3. Limited by hardware: The performance benefits of multithreading are limited by the number of available cores or processors \n",
